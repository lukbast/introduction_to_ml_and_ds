## introduction_to_ml_and_ds

This repo contains notebooks and projects that I created while doing the
Complete Machine Learning and Data Science Bootcamp by Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Bourke
combined with my own experiments and tinkering.

## Breaking down the repo

This repo contains 4 sections:

[Introduction to DS and ML tools]() - this directory contain noteboks
which show most common and useful functions of NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Sci-Kit learn.

[Heart Disease Project]() - end-to-end project that introduce classification problem
and how to approach it using tools mentioned above.

[Bulldozer pricing project]() - end-to-end project introduce regression problem
and how to approach it using tools mentioned above.

[Dog vision]() - Multiclass image classification project that shows process of creating deep machine learning model with Tensorflow.
Model created in this project recognise 120 different dog breeds based on their images.
